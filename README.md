# Twin-T Kick Drum
This is a simple 4HP kick drum module based on krakenpine's design.<br>
If you want to know/learn more about it, check out this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iETSEz60OVA).<br><br>
I don't post the schematic here, because it is already available in the [original repository](https://github.com/Krakenpine/krakenpine-synthing) but in my BOM I have a few changes to the original design.<br><br>
All credits go to Krakenpine!
